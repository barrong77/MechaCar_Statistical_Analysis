Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

In the total summary, we can see the variance of all three lots in tandem does fall under the maximum variance of 100 PSI with a variance of 62 PSI.

In the lot summary, we see that the major contributor to the variance is lot 3 with a variance of 170 PSI with the other two lots having variances below 8 PSI.

In total, the manufacturing data meets the maximum variance in PSI requirement, but we can see that there are clearly big problems in lot 3 with a variance of 170 PSI. Lot 3 does not meet the maximum variance requirement.
